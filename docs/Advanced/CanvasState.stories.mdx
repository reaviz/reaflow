# Canvas state

This Storybook demo showcases `React.useState` as state manager, because it's very simple to comprehend and simple apps could actually use it for real.

But, as your app growths, you might need to have some shared state and use a shared State manager.

## What state manager should be used with reaflow?

Reaflow is store-agnostic and doesn't recommend any store manager in particular. The choice is yours.

If you're unfamiliar with React State managers, we recommend watching [What State Management Library Should I Use with React?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_o09PD_qAs&feature=emb_logo&ab_channel=LeeRobinson).

## Immutability when using `React.useState`

> If you're using `React.useState`, be careful about immutability.

While React `useState` will not throw when mutate the state directly, it won't actually work.

```tsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { NodeData } from 'reaflow';

const [nodes, setNodes] = useState<NodeData[]>([]);

...

const newNodes = nodes; // DO NOT DO THAT
newNodes[0] = { id: '1' };
console.log('updateCurrentNode new nodes', newNodes); // Will print the expected object

setNodes(newNodes); // Will not crash, but won't actually mutate the state for real

```

You must not mutate the state directly `nodes`, but clone it first.

```tsx
import cloneDeep from 'lodash.clonedeep';

const newNodes = nodes; // DO NOT DO THAT
const newNodes = cloneDeep(nodes); // Do that instead
```

You can use the library of your choice to clone the state, `lodash.clonedeep` is a good choice.

> [This is not a bug, it's expected](https://github.com/reaviz/reaflow/issues/43#issuecomment-774012401). Although, it is very confusing because `newNodes` shows the expected value in the console.
It would be a better developer experience for React to throw an exception when mutating the state directly. _(it's what `recoil` does)_
