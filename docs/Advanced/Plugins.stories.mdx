# Plugins

Below is a list of some library and examples to further enhance reaflow.

## Zooming and panning
> Super fast and light react npm package for zooming, panning and pinching html elements in easy way

[React-zoom-pan-pinch](https://github.com/prc5/react-zoom-pan-pinch): By wrapping
the Reaflow graph in the `TransformWrapper` of this library Mobile gestures,
touchpad gestures and desktop mouse events are enabled. The graph can be
scrolled via the mouse wheel and panned by dragging the canvas. The library
provides a rich interface for interaction events.

Properties:
- `wheel={{step: 40}}` - Define the zoom steps for each mouse wheel step
- `minScale` and `maxScale` - Define the minimum and maximum zoom
- `limitToBounds` - Define if the graph should be allowed to be pannable out of the view

To mitigate complications, make sure to deactivate the reaflow native
zoom feature by setting `zoomable={false}`.

```tsx
import { TransformWrapper, TransformComponent } from "react-zoom-pan-pinch";
...
<TransformWrapper
  wheel={{ step: 40 }}
  options={{
    maxScale: 4,
    limitToBounds: false
  }}
>
  <TransformComponent>
    <Canvas
      zoomable={false}
      fit={true}
      nodes={...}
      edges={...}
    />
  </TransformComponent>
</TransformWrapper>
```
