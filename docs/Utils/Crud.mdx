# Getting Started with Utils

There a variety of common interactions you want to make
with the canvas and graph. reaflow has some helpers out of
the box to help manage those typical operations. Those
helpers are broken up into two categories:

- CRUD - Dealing with manipulating nodes/edges
- Graph - Dealing with traversing the graph
- Extended Utils - More use-case focused helpers

#### Notes
> These helpers are very generic and meant to help people getting started, but they're not meant to cover specific use-cases.
>
> You should copy them and adapt them to your own needs if they don't cover your needs. [See discussion](https://github.com/reaviz/reaflow/issues/47#issuecomment-775919579).
>
> There are advanced examples in [Extending Utils](/?path=/story/docs-utils-extending--page) page.
