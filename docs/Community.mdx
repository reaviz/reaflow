## Opensource
Examples of open-source projects using reaflow:

- [POC Next.js + Reaflow](https://github.com/Vadorequest/poc-nextjs-reaflow): Uses
Reaflow to build a "**decision tree**". Advanced use-case with different kinds
of nodes with heavy usage of `foreignObject` to display actual HTML within the nodes themselves.
Hosted on Vercel and built with Next.js 10.

- [JSON Visio](https://github.com/AykutSarac/jsonvisio.com): Uses
Reaflow to mirror JSON onto "**graphs**". JSON Visio is data visualization tool for your json data which seamlessly illustrates your data on graphs without having to restructure anything, paste directly or import file.
