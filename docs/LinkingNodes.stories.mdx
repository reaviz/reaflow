# Linking Nodes
reaflow allows users to edit graphs by adding/removing and
linking nodes together dynamically. There are 2 event handlers
you can subscribe to for checking if a node can be linked
and performing the actual link.

- `onNodeLinkCheck` - Function you can implement to return true/false if node can link
- `onNodeLink` - Function you implement to perform the actual link

Below is a example showing how one might use these two functions together:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Canvas, hasLink } from 'reaflow';

const nodes = [
  {
    id: '1',
    text: '1'
  },
  {
    id: '2',
    text: '2'
  }
];

const edges = [];

export default () => (
  <Canvas
    nodes={nodes}
    edges={edges}
    onNodeLinkCheck={(from: NodeData, to: NodeData) => {
      return !hasLink(edges, from, to);
    }}
    onNodeLink={(from, to) => {
      const id = `${from.id}-${to.id}`;

      setEdges([
        ...edges,
        {
          id,
          from: from.id,
          to: to.id
        }
      ]);
    }}
  />
);
```

In the example, we take advantage of one of the
helpers in the library called `hasLink` which will
return if the node is already linked.

In order to actually add the link, you can
implement the `onNodeLink` which is a function
that should set a new edge with pointers to the
source and target node.
